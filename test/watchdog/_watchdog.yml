  # This configuration is a bit of a /hack/ so that the executable scripts are
  # executable, but not readable, in the solution directory. After the
  # permission policy is applied, scripts in the sh/ directory will be readable
  # and executable while scripts in sh/**/solution/**/ will be executable only.
  # Although files may be executable by default, the lack of default permissions
  # for other will prevent anyone from actually executing code.
